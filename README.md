## CURRENT STATUS: Project Initiated

I realized that there aren't enough math based JavaScript libraries out there. I don't think there's a JS-based alternative to numPy.

Well, the reason I'm building this project is that I've to start re-learning all the math I either forgot or didn't bother learning. 

I intend on making this library simplify a number of common mathematical calculations, especially ones the grades 11 and 12 [NCERT](http://www.ncert.nic.in/) textbooks deal with.

I do have more far-reaching goals than just getting good at mathematics. I'll update this README once this project has proceeded significantly. 

This will take time to develop. 

Thanks for your interest. I'll be more encouraged if you star this repo. ;)
